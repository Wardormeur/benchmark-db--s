The goal of this repo is to figure a way to still make proper use of Relational DB in µservices
with the lowest read latency
So far :
[x] IN query with separated queries
[] IN query with consolidated data
[x] reference JOIN
[] cost of transport
  - small (id) vs large (context)
[] cross db join (dblink)
[] cost of transport (separate query µs, fdw)
[] separate caching for read (memcache, redis) with transformed data

To look into : 
pre-indexing to simulate real prod env
